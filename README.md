# CRUD operation in NodeJs with jest testing lib.

**Version 1.0.0**

This is a simple CRUD Backend App that implements Create, Read, Update and Delete operations.
By using Jest testing lib to match what I have learn so far. It is used in Unit/ Integration test to ensure operation is working 
perfectly.


Operation of testing will go from unit Testing => Integration Testing => Manual Testing.

---
## Operations of Testing
- UNIT Testing (testing units of implementation to individual codes).
- Integration Testing (Testing implementation with databases, an overall request operation from client.)
- Manual Testing (Testing Manually with the provided routes with POSTMEN or other applications or extensions)

---

## Schema used
- Courses with parameters of title(serving as course title), desc(serving as title description).
- Both parameters fields are required.
---
## Setup and running the backend
- npm install or yarn install to install all dependencies required in this project. (dependencies can be view in package.json)
- connect your mongodb url in mongodb.connect.js file
- npm run dev or yarn dev in running at nodemon mode.
- npm run start or yarn start in running node mode.
- npm run test or yarn test in running jest --watchAll mode.
